# gulp-init

Instead of having a `gulp init` command we chose to make a wiki page to get you started.

Here is what a `gulp init` command would have done:

1. Run `npm install gulp --save`
2. Place the following code in gulpfile.js

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function(){
  // place code for your default task here
});
```

See? Pretty simple. No need for a command.
